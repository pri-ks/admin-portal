# Sample ReactJS 18 Application for an Admin Portal

The application is a demonstration of a generic web application that caters to the needs of customers requiring customisation to their business website. It consists of a login page and an interface for a business owner to manage his online business processes like business branches, inventory of items, orders, sales data etc.  
The data displayed is sample hardcoded data but the application has REST API calls implemented. It can be integrated with the backend APIs writen in any languages like JAVA Spring Boot or ASP.NET Framework.

## Login Page:
The authentication in login page is added by calling a dummy public API of Postman, the credentials for which are as follows:  
username: admin  
password: Admin11
